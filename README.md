# **Machine learning with Python**

The Machine learning with Python plugin uses Moodle's Python-based machine learning solution. With this plugin you gain access to the predictions processor " Python LMSwithAI machine learning backend ", which allows you to perform machine learning operations in the Python environment without having to install the environment locally.

Documentation
=============

**Main assumptions**

1.	The plugin allows you to easily and securely connect to a dedicated Python server tailored to your machine learning needs. This allows you to use advanced libraries and tools available in the Python ecosystem, without having to install them locally.

2.	The plugin bases its operation on solutions provided by the Moodle developer
   in the field of machine learning.

3.	The plugin takes care of data security and access to Python server resources. Authentication and permissions mechanisms ensure that only authorized users have access to machine learning resources while protecting data privacy.
4.	Since both the plugin and access to the server is free, the response time to the request to perform learning and prediction operations may be extended.

**To access the Python server, please contact us contact@lmswithai.com**
